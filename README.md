üîß How It Works
1. Fetching Product Data
The scraper sends an HTTP GET request to Leyon Super's product page.
The HTML content is parsed using BeautifulSoup to extract product details.
Each product's name, price, image URL, and product page link are gathered and stored.


2. Displaying Data in Tkinter GUI
A Tkinter Treeview widget is used to display the product data in a table.
A Pillow image display area is used to show the product image when a row is selected.
3. Saving Data
The scraped data is saved as a JSON file, which includes product details such as name, price, image URL, and product link.
üìù How to Modify or Extend
You can update the URL in the script to scrape products from other websites.
Modify the HTML element selectors (such as class names) if the website structure changes.
Enhance the user interface to show additional product details or add more features.
